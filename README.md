Repository containing all code written for University of Edinburgh School of Mathematics fourth year project: "Evaluating the Fairness of Political Constituencies:  an Application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling".

Code written by Cameron Stephen, Luke Donnelly and Katie Hassell.

Notes on use of code

the script finding_maps.py can be run as is to generate a sample of maps. Change the value of n on line 143 to change the number of maps generated.

Once mpas have been generated, the script getting_results_test.py can be run to generate and show results from the generated maps. the directory for the maps is distinct_directory stored as new_map_directory and the directory for the graphs to be displayed is graphs_directory. The code in this section need re-writen, so bear with us .
